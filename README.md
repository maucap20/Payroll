Description

The Payroll Tracking Application is a web-based tool designed for payroll managers to easily view and manage employee payroll data. This application allows managers to add employees, including their first name, last name, and salary, and provides a clean, responsive user interface for viewing all employee data. The app dynamically updates the displayed employee information and aggregates payroll data, making budgeting more manageable for companies.

Usage

    Click on the "Add Employee" button.
    You will be prompted to enter the employee's first name, last name, and salary.
    After adding an employee, choose whether to add another or cancel the process.
    When you cancel, the employee list will be displayed alphabetically by last name, and the console will display computed and aggregated payroll data for all employees.
